            <p class="card-text text-secondary">Mahatma Gandhi was a central figure in India's struggle for independence, known for his unique approach of non-violence and civil disobedience. He led several key movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Salt March, and the Quit India Movement, which mobilized millions of Indians against British rule. Through his philosophy of Satyagraha, or peaceful resistance, Gandhi challenged colonial authority without resorting to violence, inspiring people across the nation. His leadership was crucial in uniting Indians of diverse backgrounds in the fight for freedom, ultimately leading to India's independence on August 15, 1947. Gandhi's commitment to truth and non-violence made him a global symbol of peaceful resistance.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-secondary">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, known as the "Iron Man of India," played a crucial role in the country's freedom struggle. A key leader in the Indian National Congress, he was instrumental in organizing peasants for the Kheda and Bardoli Satyagrahas, which were significant non-violent resistance movements against British policies. Patel was a close ally of Mahatma Gandhi and supported the major movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Quit India Movement.

              After India gained independence, Patel's most notable contribution was the integration of over 560 princely states into the newly independent nation, ensuring India's unity and stability. His leadership and determination earned him immense respect, making him one of the foremost architects of modern India.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-secondary">Bhagat Singh was a revolutionary hero of India's freedom struggle, known for his fearless activism against British rule. Born in 1907, he became a prominent figure in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and advocated for complete independence through radical means. Bhagat Singh gained national attention after his involvement in the assassination of a British officer, J.P. Saunders, in retaliation for the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai.

              He further solidified his legacy by throwing non-lethal bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929, shouting slogans of revolution and demanding freedom for India. Arrested and tried, Bhagat Singh used his trial to promote his ideas of anti-colonialism and socialism, becoming a symbol of youth and sacrifice. He was executed at the age of 23, on March 23, 1931, but his courage and martyrdom continue to inspire generations in India's ongoing pursuit of justice and equality.</p>

           <p class="card-text text-secondary">Bal Gangadhar Tilak, often called the "Father of Indian Unrest," was a prominent leader in India's freedom struggle and a strong advocate for self-rule (Swaraj). Born in 1856, Tilak was one of the first leaders to inspire a mass movement against British rule. He believed that independence was the birthright of every Indian and worked tirelessly to awaken national consciousness.

            Tilak's slogan, "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it," became a rallying cry for millions. He used his newspapers, Kesari and Maratha, to spread nationalist ideas and criticize British policies. Tilak also played a key role in popularizing the Ganesh Chaturthi festival as a platform for political mobilization. His assertive stance and ability to connect with the masses made him a revered figure in the freedom struggle, paving the way for later leaders like Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

           <p class="card-text text-secondary">Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, is one of the most iconic figures in India's fight for independence. Born in 1828, she became a symbol of resistance against British rule during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence.

            When the British attempted to annex her kingdom under the Doctrine of Lapse after her husband's death, Rani Lakshmi Bai refused to surrender Jhansi. She led her troops with remarkable courage and valor, fiercely defending her kingdom against the British forces. Despite being heavily outnumbered, she fought bravely in the battle, becoming a symbol of resistance and national pride.
            
            Her leadership and bravery inspired many others in the freedom struggle, and she is remembered as a fearless warrior and a martyr who sacrificed her life for India's independence. Rani Lakshmi Bai's legacy continues to inspire generations as a symbol of courage, patriotism, and the relentless fight for freedom.</p>

           <p class="card-text text-secondary">Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a prominent and daring leader in India's struggle for independence. Born in 1897, Bose was a key figure who sought complete and immediate independence from British rule. He initially worked within the Indian National Congress but later broke away due to ideological differences, advocating for a more militant approach to achieving freedom.

            Bose is best known for forming the Indian National Army (INA) during World War II, with the goal of liberating India by force. He famously sought help from Axis powers and led the INA in several battles against British forces in India. His rallying cry, "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom," inspired many to join the fight.
            
            Though the INA's military campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, Bose's efforts significantly contributed to the weakening of British authority in India. His courage, patriotism, and relentless pursuit of independence made him a national hero, and his legacy continues to inspire the spirit of freedom and determination in India.</p>
